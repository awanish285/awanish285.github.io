<html>  
<head>  
<title>Web page title</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
<h1>Write Your First Heading</h1>  
<p>Write Your First Paragraph.</p>  
</body>  
</html>


#Description of HTML Example

<!DOCTYPE>: It defines the document type or it instruct the browser about the version of HTML.

#<html > :

1) This tag informs the browser that it is an HTML document. 
2) Text between html tag describes the web document. 
3) It is a container for all other elements of HTML except <!DOCTYPE>


#<head>:

1) It should be the first element inside the <html> element, which contains the metadata(information about the document). 
2) It must be closed before the body tag opens.


#<title>:
 
1) As its name suggested, it is used to add title of that HTML page which appears at the top of the browser window. 
2) It must be placed inside the head tag and should close immediately. (Optional)


#<body> : 

1) Text between body tag describes the body content of the page that is visible to the end user. 
2) This tag contains the main content of the HTML document.

#<h1> : 

Text between <h1> tag describes the first level heading of the webpage.

#<p> : 

Text between <p> tag describes the paragraph of the webpage.



#Features of HTML

1) It is a very easy and simple language. It can be easily understood and modified.

2) It is very easy to make an effective presentation with HTML because it has a lot of formatting tags.

3) It is a markup language, so it provides a flexible way to design web pages along with the text.

4) It facilitates programmers to add a link on the web pages (by html anchor tag), so it enhances the interest of browsing of the user.

5) It is platform-independent because it can be displayed on any platform like Windows, Linux, and Macintosh, etc.

6) It facilitates the programmer to add Graphics, Videos, and Sound to the web pages which makes it more attractive and interactive.

7) HTML is a case-insensitive language, which means we can use tags either in lower-case or upper-case.

#CSS:

The major points of CSS are given below:

1) CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
2) CSS is used to design HTML tags.
3) CSS is a widely used language on the web.
4) HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for web designing. It helps the web designers to apply style on HTML tags.



#What is CSS
1) CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. 
2) It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. 
3) It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. 
4) It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
5) CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and user interfaces for many mobile applications.


#What does CSS do
1) You can add new looks to your old HTML documents.
2) You can completely change the look of your website with only a few changes in CSS code.



#Why use CSS
These are the three major benefits of CSS:

1) Solves a big problem
2) Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. 
3) This was a very long process. 
#For example: 
If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will be become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. 
It was a W3C recommendation.

# 2) Saves a lot of time
CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.

# 3) Provide more attributes
CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.


#CSS Syntax
A CSS rule set contains a selector and a declaration block.

# CSS syntax Example:

h1{color:yelow; font-size:11px;}


#Selector: 
Selector indicates the HTML element you want to style. It could be any tag like <h1>, <title> etc.


#Declaration Block: 

The declaration block can contain one or more declarations separated by a semicolon. For the above example, there are two declarations:

color: yellow;
font-size: 11 px;
Each declaration contains a property name and value, separated by a colon.

#Property: 
A Property is a type of attribute of HTML element. It could be color, border etc.

#Value: 

Values are assigned to CSS properties. In the above example, value "yellow" is assigned to color property.
