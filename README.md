#What is HTML
1) HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. 
2) Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

#The major points of HTML are given below:


1) HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
2) HTML is used to create web pages and web applications.
3) HTML is widely used language on the web.
4) We can create a static website by HTML only.
5) Technically, HTML is a Markup language rather than a programming language.

#Hyper Text: 
1) HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. 
2) Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. 
3) HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other


#Markup language: 
1) A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. 
2) Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. 
3) It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.


#Web Page: 
1) A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. 
2) A web page can be identified by entering an URL. 
3) A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

#example of HTML.

<!DOCTYPE>  
<html>  
<head>  
<title>Web page title</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
<h1>Write Your First Heading</h1>  
<p>Write Your First Paragraph.</p>  
</body>  
</html>


#Description of HTML Example

<!DOCTYPE>: It defines the document type or it instruct the browser about the version of HTML.

#<html > :

1) This tag informs the browser that it is an HTML document. 
2) Text between html tag describes the web document. 
3) It is a container for all other elements of HTML except <!DOCTYPE>


#<head>:

1) It should be the first element inside the <html> element, which contains the metadata(information about the document). 
2) It must be closed before the body tag opens.


#<title>:
 
1) As its name suggested, it is used to add title of that HTML page which appears at the top of the browser window. 
2) It must be placed inside the head tag and should close immediately. (Optional)


#<body> : 

1) Text between body tag describes the body content of the page that is visible to the end user. 
2) This tag contains the main content of the HTML document.

#<h1> : 

Text between <h1> tag describes the first level heading of the webpage.

#<p> : 

Text between <p> tag describes the paragraph of the webpage.



#Features of HTML

1) It is a very easy and simple language. It can be easily understood and modified.

2) It is very easy to make an effective presentation with HTML because it has a lot of formatting tags.

3) It is a markup language, so it provides a flexible way to design web pages along with the text.

4) It facilitates programmers to add a link on the web pages (by html anchor tag), so it enhances the interest of browsing of the user.

5) It is platform-independent because it can be displayed on any platform like Windows, Linux, and Macintosh, etc.

6) It facilitates the programmer to add Graphics, Videos, and Sound to the web pages which makes it more attractive and interactive.

7) HTML is a case-insensitive language, which means we can use tags either in lower-case or upper-case.


=================================================================================================================================================================================
#CSS:

The major points of CSS are given below:

1) CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
2) CSS is used to design HTML tags.
3) CSS is a widely used language on the web.
4) HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for web designing. It helps the web designers to apply style on HTML tags.



#What is CSS
1) CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. 
2) It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. 
3) It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. 
4) It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
5) CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and user interfaces for many mobile applications.


#What does CSS do
1) You can add new looks to your old HTML documents.
2) You can completely change the look of your website with only a few changes in CSS code.



#Why use CSS
These are the three major benefits of CSS:

1) Solves a big problem
2) Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. 
3) This was a very long process. 
#For example: 
If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will be become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. 
It was a W3C recommendation.

# 2) Saves a lot of time
CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.

# 3) Provide more attributes
CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.


#CSS Syntax
A CSS rule set contains a selector and a declaration block.

# CSS syntax Example:

h1{color:yelow; font-size:11px;}


#Selector: 
Selector indicates the HTML element you want to style. It could be any tag like <h1>, <title> etc.


#Declaration Block: 

The declaration block can contain one or more declarations separated by a semicolon. For the above example, there are two declarations:

color: yellow;
font-size: 11 px;
Each declaration contains a property name and value, separated by a colon.

#Property: 
A Property is a type of attribute of HTML element. It could be color, border etc.

#Value: 

Values are assigned to CSS properties. In the above example, value "yellow" is assigned to color property.

======================================================================================================================================================
#javaScript:

1) JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.

2) JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.

#What is JavaScript:
1) JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. 
2) It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. 
3) It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. 
4) Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. 
5) The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.




#Features of JavaScript
#There are following features of JavaScript:

1) All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
2) JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
3) JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
4) JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
5) It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
6) It is a case-sensitive language.
7) JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
8) It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.


# Application of JavaScript
JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:

1) Client-side validation,
2) Dynamic drop-down menus,
3) Displaying date and time,
4) Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
5) Displaying clocks etc.

#JavaScript Example

<script>  
document.write("Hello JavaScript by JavaScript");  
</script> 

1) The script tag specifies that we are using JavaScript.

2) The text/javascript is the content type that provides information to the browser about the data.

3) The document.write() function is used to display dynamic content through JavaScript.

# Places to put JavaScript code

1) Between the body tag of html
2) Between the head tag of html
3) In .js file (external javaScript)

# JavaScript Example : code between the body tag
In the above example, we have displayed the dynamic content using JavaScript. Let’s see the simple example of JavaScript that displays alert dialog box.

<script type="text/javascript">  
 alert("Hello Javatpoint");  
</script> 



# JavaScript Example : code between the head tag
1) Let’s see the same example of displaying alert dialog box of JavaScript that is contained inside the head tag.

2) In this example, we are creating a function msg(). To create function in JavaScript, you need to write function with function_name as given below.

3) To call function, you need to work on event. Here we are using onclick event to call msg() function. 


<html>  
<head>  
<script type="text/javascript">  
function msg(){  
 alert("Hello Javatpoint");  
}  
</script>  
</head>  
<body>  
<p>Welcome to JavaScript</p>  
<form>  
<input type="button" value="click" onclick="msg()"/>  
</form>  
</body>  
</html>  


#External JavaScript file
1) We can create external JavaScript file and embed it in many html page.

2) It provides code re usability because single JavaScript file can be used in several html pages.

3) An external JavaScript file must be saved by .js extension. It is recommended to embed all JavaScript files into a single file. It increases the speed of the webpage.

#message.js

function msg(){  
 alert("Hello Javatpoint");  
}  


<html>  
<head>  
<script type="text/javascript" src="message.js"></script>  
</head>  
<body>  
<p>Welcome to JavaScript</p>  
<form>  
<input type="button" value="click" onclick="msg()"/>  
</form>  
</body>  
</html>  

#Advantages of External JavaScript
There will be following benefits if a user creates an external javascript:

1) It helps in the reusability of code in more than one HTML file.
2) It allows easy code readability.
3) It is time-efficient as web browsers cache the external js files, which further reduces the page loading time.
4) It enables both web designers and coders to work with html and js files parallelly and separately, i.e., without facing any code conflictions.
5) The length of the code reduces as only we need to specify the location of the js file.



#Disadvantages of External JavaScript
There are the following disadvantages of external files:

1) The stealer may download the coder's code using the url of the js file.
2) If two js files are dependent on one another, then a failure in one file may affect the execution of the other dependent file.
3) The web browser needs to make an additional http request to get the js code.
4) A tiny to a large change in the js code may cause unexpected results in all its dependent files.
5) We need to check each file that depends on the commonly created external javascript file.
6) If it is a few lines of code, then better to implement the internal javascript code.

#Git

#What is Git?
1) Git is an open-source distributed version control system. 
2) It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. 
3) It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

#Features of GitHub
GitHub is a place where programmers and designers work together. 
They collaborate, contribute, and fix bugs together. It hosts plenty of open source projects and codes of various programming languages.

#Some of its significant features are as follows.

1) Collaboration
2) Integrated issue and bug tracking
3) Graphical representation of branches
4) Git repositories hosting
5) Project management
6) Team management
7) Code hosting
8) Track and assign tasks
9) Conversations
10) Wikisc


#Benefits of GitHub
GitHub can be separated as the Git and the Hub. GitHub service includes access controls as well as collaboration features like task management, repository hosting, and team management.

The key benefits of GitHub are as follows.

1) It is easy to contribute to open source projects via GitHub.
2) It helps to create an excellent document.
3) You can attract recruiter by showing off your work. If you have a profile on GitHub, you will have a higher chance of being recruited.
4) It allows your work to get out there in front of the public.
5) You can track changes in your code across versions.


#Why is git needed?

1) When a team works on real-life projects, git helps ensure no code conflicts between the developers. 
2) Furthermore, the project requirements change often. So a git manages all the versions. If needed, we can also go back to the original code. 
3) The concept of branching allows several projects to run in the same codebase.

#Git Terminology
#Branch
1) A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. 
2) It is an essential feature available in most modern version control systems. A Git project can have more than one branch. 
3) We can perform many operations on Git branch-like rename, list, delete, etc.

#Checkout
1) In Git, the term checkout is used for the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. 
2) The git checkout command is used to switch between branches in a repository.

#Cherry-Picking
1) Cherry-picking in Git is meant to apply some commit from one branch into another branch. 
2) In case you made a mistake and committed a change into the wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch. 
3) You can revert the commit and cherry-pick it on another branch.

#Clone
1) The git clone is a Git command-line utility. It is used to make a copy of the target repository or clone it. 
2) If I want a local copy of my repository from GitHub, this tool allows creating a local copy of that repository on your local directory from the repository URL.

#Fetch
1) It is used to fetch branches and tags from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their histories. 
2) It updates the remote-tracking branches.

#HEAD
1) HEAD is the representation of the last commit in the current checkout branch. 
2) We can think of the head like a current branch. When you switch branches with git checkout, the HEAD revision changes, and points the new branch.

#Master
1) Master is a naming convention for Git branch. It's a default branch of Git. 
2) After cloning a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository contains only a single local branch. This branch is called a "master" branch. It means that "master" is a repository's "default" branch.

#Merge
1) Merging is a process to put a forked history back together. 
2) The git merge command facilitates you to take the data created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

#Origin
1) In Git, "origin" is a reference to the remote repository from a project was initially cloned. 
2) More precisely, it is used instead of that original repository URL to make referencing much easier.

#Git Revert
1) In Git, the term revert is used to revert some commit. To revert a commit, git revert command is used. 
2) It is an undo type command. However, it is not a traditional undo alternative.

#Git Reset
1) In Git, the term reset stands for undoing changes. The git reset command is used to reset the changes. 
2) The git reset command has three core forms of invocation. These forms are as follows.

a) Soft
b) Mixed
c) Hard
#Git Ignore
1) In Git, the term ignore used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. 
2) It doesn't affect the Files that already tracked by Git.
